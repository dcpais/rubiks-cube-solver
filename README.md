## Introduction

This project utilizes React.js and Three.js to create an interactive 3D Rubik's Cube solver. Users can manipulate the virtual Rubik's Cube through mouse or touch inputs, observe the changes in real-time, and use provided solving algorithms to solve the Rubik's Cube.

## Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-rubiks-cube-solver.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd 3d-rubiks-cube-solver
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

Usage
Once the application is running, users can interact with the virtual Rubik's Cube by clicking and dragging on its faces. Additionally, users can access solving algorithms to solve the Rubik's Cube using the provided functionality.

Rubik's Cube Solving Algorithms
This section provides information about the Rubik's Cube solving algorithms utilized in the project. Currently, the following solving algorithms are implemented:

Beginner's Method: This method is suitable for beginners and consists of several intuitive steps to solve the Rubik's Cube layer by layer.

CFOP Method (Fridrich Method): CFOP stands for Cross, F2L (First Two Layers), OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer), and PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer). It is an advanced method used by speedcubers to solve the Rubik's Cube efficiently.

For detailed explanations and implementation details of each solving algorithm, refer to the corresponding source code files.
