## Introduction

This project utilizes React.js and Three.js to create an interactive 3D Rubik's Cube solver. Users can manipulate the virtual Rubik's Cube through mouse inputs to play with the rubiks cube, and also use provided solving algorithms to solve the Rubik's Cube.

## Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-rubiks-cube-solver.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd 3d-rubiks-cube-solver
    ```
    
3. Install dependencies and run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npx vite
    ```

## Usage
Once the application is running, users can interact with the virtual Rubik's Cube by clicking and dragging on its faces to rotate the cube as expected. Additionally, users can access solving algorithms to see how a Rubik's cube can be solved.
